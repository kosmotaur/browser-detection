# Browser detection

Detect the browser (or browser set) by the features it supports. It is virtually impossible to tackle this, unlike for UA sniffing.
The drawbacks are that feature support data does not make it possible to pinpoint exact vendor/browser for every browser out there.
Currently it recognizes Safari, IE, Opera, and approximately recognizes Firefox and Chrome.

The script takes into account a set of browsers you wanna determine if the visitor falls in to. You configure that in ``config/browserSet.js``. If it is not possible to tell, it falls back to UA sniffing

## Usage

1. In config directory, copy templates to the same directory removing 'template.' from the name. Change contents as needed.
2. [Update and pre-process caniuse.com data](#updating-and-pre-processing-data)
3. For the page where you want to detect the browser, include 2 custom built libraries (Modernizr and lodash) and browserTest-min.js built in the previous step

``BT.test()`` does the full test, falling back to UA sniffing if necessary, and tells you if the detected set is a subset of your browser set configured in ``config/browserSet.js``
``BT.detectByFeatures()`` tests only by features, and calculates a diff between the browsers likely to be the one currently tested and those you define in browserSet.js.
The diff object contains the intersection and difference between the set you wanna make sure the browser falls into (``config/browserSet.js``) and the set determined by tests. If there is only intersection, and no difference, then you got yourself what you were looking for.

See ``test.html`` file to see an example.

## Strategy

* <http://caniuse.com/> and <http://modernizr.com/>
	* node data preprocessing
		* get support data from Github at https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse.git â€” the ``data.json`` file has both support data as well as a listing of past, current and near future browser versions
		* extract needed information from ``data.json``
			* write support data mappable to features detected by Modernizr (the mapping object can be found in ``prepare/index.js``) to ``supportData.js``
			* write current browser versions to ``browserVersions.js``
	* in the browser
		* iterate through features of ``supportData.js``
		* if Modernizr indicates feature is supported, get all browsers/versions from ``supportData`` which do not support that feature and remove those browseres/versions from ``browserVersions`` collection
		* if Modernizr indicates feature is not supported, get all browsers/versions from ``supportData`` which support that feature and remove those browseres/versions from ``browserVersions`` collection
		* if remaining browsers is a non-emtpy subset of supported browsers collection, the currently checked browser is supported
		* if remaining browsers is an empty set, move on to fallback
* userAgent sniffing as fallback, based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com)'s solution

## Updating and pre-processing data
``$ cd prepare``
``$ npm install`` (only have to do this once)
``$ node index.js``

## Prerequisites

### Node preprocessing

* node >=v0.8
* git CLI installed

### Browser

* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) - custom build with selected feature tests found in ``prepare/index.js`` in ``modernizrToCaniuseMapping`` object
* [lodash](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash) custom build: ``lodash category="collections, arrays" exports="global"`` (install it by ``npm install -g lodash``)
