// The tests from Modernizr having support data in caniuse.com â€” the default set narrows down the suspect browsers by quite much,
// so you can just copy this file to modernizrToCaniuseMapping.js and leave it be.
// Or you can modify the mappings to fit your needs.
// Remember that the Modernizr build included in this repo is a custom build containing only the feature tests from this
// mapping; if you change it, you will need to configure and download your own matching build on http://modernizr.com/
